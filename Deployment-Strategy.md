1.What are Git tags, and how do they differ from branches?
Git tags are a way to mark specific points in a Git repository's history. They are similar to branches, but they are not used to track changes over time. Instead, tags are used to mark specific releases or milestones in a project's development.Tags are created using the `git tag` command. The command takes a tag name as its argument, and it creates a new tag object in the repository. The tag object stores the SHA-1 hash of the commit that is being tagged, as well as the tag name and the date and time that the tag was created.Tags can be used to identify specific commits in a repository's history. They can also be used to create release archives or to deploy code to a production environment.Here are some of the key differences between tags and branches:
* Tags are used to mark specific points in a repository's history, while branches are used to track changes over time.
* Tags are immutable, while branches can be changed.* Tags are typically used to mark releases or milestones, while branches are typically used for development.In general, tags are a useful way to mark important points in a project's development. They can be used to identify specific commits, create release archives, and deploy code to a production environment.
	
2.How can Git tags help in managing and tracking deployments?
Git tags can be used to track and manage deployments by providing a way to mark specific points in a project's history. This can be useful for identifying which version of the code was deployed to a particular environment, or for rolling back to a previous version if necessary.To use Git tags for deployment tracking, you can create a new tag each time you deploy a new version of the code. This can be done using the `git tag` command, followed by the name of the tag and the SHA-1 hash of the commit that you want to tag.For example, to create a tag for the latest version of the code, you would use the following command:
git tag v1.0.0 HEAD Once you have created a tag, you can use it to identify the commit that was deployed to a particular environment. To do this, you can use the `git show` command, followed by the name of the tag.For example, to view the commit that was tagged with `v1.0.0`, you would use the following command:git show v1.0.0
â€‹You can also use Git tags to roll back to a previous version of the code if necessary. To do this, you can use the `git reset` command, followed by the name of the tag that you want to roll back to.For example, to roll back to the version of the code that was tagged with `v0.9.0`, you would use the following command.Using Git tags to track and manage deployments can be a helpful way to keep track of which version of the code is deployed to which environment, and to roll back to a previous version if necessary.

	
3.How would you use Git tags to ensure a stable and reliable deployment to the client's production environment?
Git tags can be used to ensure a stable and reliable deployment to the client's production environment by providing a way to mark specific points in a project's history. This can be useful for identifying which version of the code was deployed to a particular environment, or for rolling back to a previous version if necessary. To use Git tags for deployment tracking, you can create a new tag each time you deploy a new version of the code. This can be done using the `git tag` command, followed by the name of the tag and the SHA-1 hash of the commit that you want to tag.
	
4.What steps should your team take to ensure that the client's production environment remains unaffected by ongoing development?
Your team should take the following steps to ensure that the client's production environment remains unaffected by ongoing development:

1. Isolate the development environment from the production environment. This can be done by using separate physical servers, virtual machines, or containers.2. Use a version control system to track changes to the code. This will allow you to roll back to a previous version of the code if necessary. 3. Create a staging environment that is identical to the production environment. This will allow you to test changes to the code before deploying them to production. 4. Use a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. This will help to ensure that deployments are consistent and reliable. 5. Monitor the production environment for errors and performance issues. This will allow you to quickly identify and fix any problems that may arise. 6. Have a rollback plan in place in case of a problem. This will allow you to quickly restore the production environment to a known good state.
